## N-Gram dashboard

A simple web app used to parse a text into n-grams, and display some basic charts based on the data.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Upload text and store as n-grams to be queried later
- [ ] Visualize data in customizable charts
- [ ] Tag texts with metadata to aid in charting (time, location, etc)
- [ ] Allow for more complex querying from the front end
- [ ] Associate texts in a corpus and run queries on n-grams in the corpus
